At University I had the chance to combine this interest with marketing and it got natural for me to want to know how customers think and what triggers them. To get some more understanding I have done some small projects and I have tested social media to understand how it works as well as how it can be used.</p></div>

						<p>I am a technical person with a strong interest in web developer. During my university studies I gained knowledge and skills in computer science. After graduating, I decided to become a developer. One of the reasons that I like web programming is because I enjoy the moment when a client see the result of my work. It means a lot to me that I can code something which others can be benefit from. </p>
						<p>I have learned HTML, DIC + CSS, Javascript, PHP and JAVA on my own. With these languages, I have completed many projects, for example building this webside. I like challenges and solving problems, which is why I never found it difficult to learn new things and grow into the role of being a web developer.</p>

Salut! This is Alina greeting you from Romania. I am a young business professional, with varied areas of interest, ranging from philosophy to cartoons. My studies have awarded me knowledge in Business Administration and Political Science and my work experience has given me a grasp of private equity statistics and tax consultancy for multinationals, involving largely tax due diligence reports for merger & acquisition deals and fiscal audits. I’m currently envisioning stepping into a business risk management role, as a next career step.</p>

<p>I had the privilege of an international academic experience in Sweden, at Linnaeus University in Växjö, which strengthened my lifelong love of travels and gave me the opportunity to meet some remarkable people. I might add I have always been skilled at languages, being keen on writing or reviewing other people’s work and offering coaching. I also speak good Spanish and I’m continuously trying to improve my German. I think I’m the person to go to for brainstorming, planning and practical problem solving and I’m always good to have around for movies and travels</p></div>
